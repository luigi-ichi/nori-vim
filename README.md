*\* Nori-vim because it is a Hidamari Sketch reference (Nori is quite the techie tenant of Hidamari-s≈ç just like us!)*, but it does have a ring to it like Neovim! ü§≠

***This branch houses the older major version 1 where it is all configured with Vimscript instead of Lua***

üëâ Version **1.1.0** (03/29/2025)

---
As I thought of backing up my Neovim configuration, housing it in a repository is a novel way of doing it, and thus creativity brought me to the creation of **Nori-vim**! Mainly as a backup, anyone can also make use of my clunky sentimental Neovim config!

As of now, my configuration concurrently uses both `init.vim` and `init.lua` (`lua/init.lua`). Clunky it may be, but making it entirely in Lua is a goal!

Built with Neovim 0.10.4 on macOS with love ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Dependencies
* `neovim`
* Everyday development utilities such as `git`, `curl`, `make`, or `gcc` (or any C or related compilers)
* A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) to be also set via your terminal of choice (for rendering icons and pseudocharacters within Neovim)
* `npm` for Nvim-Treesitter and LspServer to communicate
* Languages setup such as `python` (or `python3`), `ruby`, among others.
* Language Server Protocols (LSPs) (i.e. `pyright` or `ruby-lsp`) installed from your respective package managers or its binaries loaded by the user (will display a message at the command bar every startup if an LSP is not installed, but will not interfere with your command sequences)

## Installation

Simply clone this into your `nvim` folder (on macOS, for example, it is in `~/.config/nvim`) and make sure to execute `firstTimeSetup.bash` (or `firstTimeSetup.ps1` for Windows) which is just a fancy script to install **vim-plug**, my plugin manager which takes care of the plugins I have on my Neovim config here!

To clone the contents of this repository directly to your `nvim` folder:
`cd <TO-YOUR-NVIM-PATH>`  
`git clone git@github.com:luigi-2ba3/nori-vim.git .`

### `where nvim`?
Here's this handy table to familiarize your Neovim path!
| Operating System        | Path                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Linux, Unix-like, macOS | `~/.config/nvim`              |
| Windows                | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\nvim` |

## Officially Tested Platforms
* macOS
    * Installed neovim via `brew`
    * Using iTerm2 instead of the native system terminal (native term does not support higher graphical capabilities)
    * Definitely need a Nerd Font to install and for the terminal to use
* Windows
    * Installed neovim via a setup executable (`.msi`)
    * Installed Git via a setup executable (`.exe`) with all default installation options
    * Windows Terminal supports everything out of the box, installing a Nerd Font may be optional
* Linux
    * Ubuntu (including Linux Mint, Lubuntu, etc.)
        * Installed neovim via `apt` (for more in-depth installations and for other distributions please refer to [neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim/Linux](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim/921fe8c40c34dd1f3fb35d5b48c484db1b8ae94b#linux))
        * Prerequisites for Python needed
        * Nerd Font required to render Neovim with this config correctly
